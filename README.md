# Representative-Points

## This Repositories is the MATLAB Code collection of Jie Li's Final Year Project (undergraduate study): Goodness-of-fit with Representative points


### Basic Logic/Structure of the Normal code:
#### Code which used to simulate the power/Type I error
* run.m : Part of the code in this m.file is used
  * main.m: called by run.m, for Normal test, it should be main_normal.m
    * MSE_Chi_Method.m: called by main.m
    * MSE_RP_Method.m: called by main.m   

#### Code which used to plot:
* forplot.m: You may need to adjust the file path


#### How to use the codeï¼š

1. Download all the code
2. Run the file **run.m**(if you want to simulate the power/type I error), or **plot.m**(if you want to plot the power)
